* Display types
********************

-> display:block

Takes up the full width available, with a new line before and after (display:block;)

-> display:inline

Takes up only as much width as it needs, and does not force new lines (display:inline;)

span default styling is display:inline block :span does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary

-> display: inline-block
An inline block is placed inline (ie. on the same line as adjacent content), but it behaves as a block.
The real use of this value is when you want to give an inline element a width. In some circumstances some browsers don't allow a width on a real inline element, but if you switch to display: inline-block you are allowed to set a width.



*****************
* Form Styling
*****************

here form__input and form__label are siblings of each other. Hence + is used to select the adjacent sibling. Should be wrtitten in this order only. If some elements are there in between the the two elements to be selected then '~' is used instead of '+'
&__input:placeholder-shown + &__label {

}
