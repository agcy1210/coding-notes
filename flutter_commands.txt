.builder method

- it renders only those items which are on the screen and not rendering items not on the screen, 
    hence it improves the performance.
- eg: GridView.builder(), ListView.builder()

*
const

- when used before a property it means it doesn't rebuild when build method is called,
    to increase the performance.
- eg: padding: const EdgeInsets.all(10.0)

* 
crossAxis and mainAxis

- crossAxis means space between columns
- mainAxis means space between rows
