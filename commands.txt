Apache Webserver commands

1) To stop your web server, type:
$ sudo systemctl stop apache2

2) To start the web server when it is stopped, type:
$ sudo systemctl start apache2

3) To stop and then start the service again, type:
$ sudo systemctl restart apache2

4) If you are simply making configuration changes, Apache can often reload without dropping connections. To do this, use this command:
$ sudo systemctl reload apache2

5) By default, Apache is configured to start automatically when the server boots. If this is not what you want, disable this behavior by typing:
$ sudo systemctl disable apache2

6) To re-enable the service to start up at boot, type:
$ sudo systemctl enable apache2

Apache should now start automatically when the server boots again.
